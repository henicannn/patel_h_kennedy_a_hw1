<p>
	8th of December 1998 was the date when a massive tornado hit the states of gujarat in India. You could sense the wind whispering "He is here." Life started for a young baby. He took his first breathe out of her mothers womb in India. He grew up slowly to be a cute boy. But life does hit us hard. 
</p>
<p>
	"Hello Heni", life whispered. I felt the fear. This was the scariest whisper. Yes, life is hard and scary, but the people who hit it hard will rise up the food chain.
